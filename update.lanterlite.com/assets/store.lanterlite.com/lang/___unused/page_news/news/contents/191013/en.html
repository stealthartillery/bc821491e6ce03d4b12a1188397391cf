<p class="p">Bismillah. Alhamdulillah wa Syukrulillah.</p>

<p>The Invix method, which is applied to Lanter Search, has now been upgraded to Invix II with data processing speeds around 3x to 5x faster than Invix I with better quality results. The quality of the results is better because Lanter Search has now reached level 4 of  intelligence where it has knowledge about synonyms and typos. Lanter Search is now able to find several words that have synonyms, as well as several words with the same purpose but with different / inaccurate typing, so that it still provides results (answers) as desired by the user.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, Lanter Search now has 4 new books as references including:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Mukhtasar Shahih Muslim, by Imam Mundzir and ordained by Shaykh Albani;</li>
<li>Silsilah Dhaifah, by Shaykh Albani;</li>
<li>Arbain Nawawi, by Imam Nawawi;</li>
<li>Riyadhus Shalihin (incomplete), by Imam Nawawi;</li>
</ol>
<p>
So now Lanter Search has 8 Islamic reference books. 
</p>

<p>
With all the achievements until today, we is hoped that Lanter Search can be an assistant in finding suitable explanations related to the understanding of Islam both for Muslims and non-Muslims.
