<p>After last Ahad the Lanterlite website published, Lanterlite publish it's Search Engine application named <a class="std" onclick="LGen.Page.change_by_url('product/lsearch')" data-tooltip="Enlite">Enlite</a>. What is <a class="std" onclick="LGen.Page.change_by_url('product/lsearch')" data-tooltip="Enlite">Enlite</a>? One of the points of Lanterlite's mission is to spread Islam throughout the world. This means that Lanterlite strives to make anyone at least understand about Islam, from any context, whether it's laws, stories, heaven and hell, etc. Lanterlite tried to make the faith of Muslims stronger, and the faith of non-Muslims grow. That's the role of <a class="std" onclick="LGen.Page.change_by_url('product/lsearch')" data-tooltip="Enlite">Enlite</a>. We try to provide insight into Islam directly from the sources, Qur'an and hadith, with clear references, even page numbers of the reference. Because one of the substance of Lanterlite's mission in spreading Islam is so that people seek knowledge from clear references. Thus <a class="std" onclick="LGen.Page.change_by_url('product/lsearch')" data-tooltip="Enlite">Enlite</a> is created as a partner of Muslims (and non-Muslims) in seeking knowledge about Islam directly from references that are clearly. Insyaa Allah.</p>
