<p class="p">Bismillah.</p>

<p>Today is a historic day in the history of Lanterlite. The official website <a class="std" href="https://www.lanterlite.com" target="_blank" data-tooltip="Situs Lanterlite">www.lanterlite.com</a> is published on 3rd February 2019. The CEO of Lanterlite, <a class="std" onclick="LGen.Page.change_by_url('member/ifandhanip')" data-tooltip="Ifan Dhani">Ifan</a> said that a company is likened to a ship. It has a screen, controls, as well as its components. All of these ships sail with the help of nature that moves by Allah's will. Many survive in the middle of the ocean, but also many of them are destroyed and sink to the bottom of the sea with a variety of causes. No matter how big the size of a ship, how long the ship sailed, everything never escape from the sight of The Creator. Therefore, <a class="std" onclick="LGen.Page.change_by_url('member/ifandhanip')" data-tooltip="Ifan Dhani">Ifan</a> said that the publication of the Lanterlite website, with all the products, achievements, status, and other information in it, should not make someone from the Lanterlite team feel arrogant then negligent from Allah's command. <a class="std" onclick="LGen.Page.change_by_url('member/ifandhanip')" data-tooltip="Ifan Dhani">Ifan</a> hoped Lanterlite can continue to grow so that it becomes a company that can change the world to be better.</p>
