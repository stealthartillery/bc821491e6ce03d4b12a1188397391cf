  <div class="subtitle">Lanter Gen II have been planted on all Lanterlite apps.</div>

<div class="date">Oct 6, 2019</div>
<p class="p">Bismillah.</p>

<p>Today we announce that all Lanterlite app systems have been applied to the Lanter Gen II system model, such as Lanter Search, Lanter Quran, etc. The color of the logo was changed with a blend of black background and gold foreground degradation. In addition, we have released the Lanterlite Information Center application on <a class="std" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lanterlite.www" target="_blank">Playstore</a> to make it easier for you to get information and news about Lanterlite, Islam, and Technology.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, we are very sorry to say that all mobile-based Lanterlite products with the Android operating system from today will not support version 4.4 (KitKat) and below because they do not support the important features in Lanter Gen II.

Thanks.
