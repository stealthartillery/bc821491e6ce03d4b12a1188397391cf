<p class="p">Bismillah.</p>

<p>Today Lanterlite announced the release of the latest version of the Lanterlite application development framework called Lanter Gen II (second generation). Lanter Gen II has better performance in terms of UI, security, and speed compared to Lanter Gen I. In general, Lanter Gen is a <i>Fast and Secure App Development</i> (FSAD). Has a unique mechanism with good quality results compared to the existing application development framework. Developed in such a way that users remain safe and comfortable while using Lanterlite applications. One of the Lanterlite applications that has been implemented by Lanter Gen II is the <a class="std" href="https://www.lanterlite.com/" target="_blank">Lanterlite Site</a> (www.lanterlite.com). All Lanterlite applications will be applied in Lanter Gen II in the near future. God willing.</p>

<p>
In addition, it was announced that the Lanterlite Trade Center website (tradelite.lanterlite.com), as well as Enlite (enlite.lanterlite.com) are being deactivated in preparation for an upgrade to the application of Lanter Gen II. All user data (including transaction data, licenses, etc.) has been moved to our new database. For you who register a Lanterlite account from now on will not be able to sign in through Lanterlite applications version 1.x because of different system mechanisms. New users can Sign in through the Lanterlite application when the application has been upgraded to version 2.x.
