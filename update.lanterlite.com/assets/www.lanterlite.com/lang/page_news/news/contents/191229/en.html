<br><br>
Today the LanterLite team announced the latest release in 2019, which is LanterApp 2.4. In this release, there is some information that we want to convey, including:
<br><br>
  
<b>1. Launching Lanter Sword Beta Test version.</b>
<br>
Lanter Sword is an MMORPG that combines RPG-based games (Role-Playing Games) with Islamic values. Quests are made not far from general knowledge about the Islamic world. The purpose of the Lanter Sword is to make it easier for people who like to play MMORPG games to be able to learn the science of Islam so that God implants a strong faith in him.
<br><br>
  
<b>2. Launching Lanter Sketch.</b>
<br>
Lanter Sketch is an application created to make it easier for users to store and access notes, both in the form of plain-text or program code, online. There are two editor views, namely Classical Note and Code Editor (equipped with HTML preview). This is done to facilitate users in accessing personal notes and program code online and as a means of sharing notes with other users (a feature to come).
<br><br>

<b>3. Company new logo and name.</b>
<br>
Lanterlite renewed its logo with the same theme, namely the lantern, but by adding meaning to its components so that the company's vision and mission implied in the new logo. In addition, the name of Lanterlite was changed to LanterLite with the capitalization on the second letter L with the intention of emphasizing the company's vision of LITE (Leading Islamic Technological Enlightment).
<br><br>

With the end of this 2019 release, we hope that each of our struggles will be replaced by Allah's reward. It is time for us to do something beneficial for the people. May Allah close this 2019 with His mercy and forgiveness and may Allah open the following year with kindness and blessings for this ummah. Thankyou for all participations that all of you had been done until today. Criticisms and suggestions for our evaluation can be sent to our email admin@lanterlite.com (please include your name in the email).
<br><br>

Jazakumullah Khairan.
