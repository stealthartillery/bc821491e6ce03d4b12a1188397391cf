	<div class="date theme fp">Nov 16, 2019</div>
	<p class="theme fp">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم </p>

	<p class="theme fp">Today the Lanterlite team announced the release of the Lanter Store app, which is a branch and successor of the Lanterlite Trade Center (LTC).</p>

	<p class="theme fp">Lanter Store is a digital goods trading center for the Lanterlite apps. Lanterlite has several products that can be upgraded by purchasing the feature license. The currency used during transactions on Lanterlite is Lanter Silver. Users can get Lanter Silver by buying it in Rupiah or exchange it for Lanter Points in the Lanter Store. Lanter Store can be accessed via the web store.lanterlite.com, or install it through PlayStore for mobile devices with the Android OS.</p>

	<p class="theme fp">As a form of gratitude, the Lanterlite team gave a number of Lanter Points to the first three people who signed up to the Lanterlite account in the first time Lanterlite account feature was created. The three people included: Abdurrahman Rizal Firdaus (10000 Lanter Points), Ibnu Ali (7500 Lanter Points), and Siti Nurul Hanifah Agustia (5000 Lanter Points). Congratulations and thankyou for being part of Lanterlite.</p>

	<p class="theme fp">In addition, the Lanterlite team also gives prizes to all accounts that have purchased any license at the Lanterlite Trade Center (before Lanter Store released) by upgrading the license to a Full License, a license that can unlock all Lanterlite features that require a license, both for present features and future, permanently.</p>

	<p class="theme fp">In addition, there is additional information that insyaa Allah Lanter Square and Lanter Sword will be released this year. The Lanterlite team asked for du'a for the ease of all these plans as well as for all of us.</p>

	<p class="theme fp">Thankyou.</p>
