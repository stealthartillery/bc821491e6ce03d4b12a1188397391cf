<p class="all_theme fp">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم </p>

<p class="all_theme fp">All Lanterlite accounts are protected by some mechanism that we have designed so that insyaa Allah they will remain secured on our servers. You can secure your account by doing some or all of these options:</p>

<p class="all_theme fp">1. Not disclosing confidential information such as e-mails and passwords to friends, family, or anyone who could threaten the security of your account. And store the information safely in anticipation if it is forgotten. </p>

<p class="all_theme fp">2. Using a password with a combination that is difficult and different from the password used on accounts in other applications outside Lanterlite. </p> 

<p class="all_theme fp">3. Make sure to always sign out after you finish using the Lanterlite application if you sign in using a device that is not your own. </p> 

<p class="all_theme fp">4. Make sure to only sign in on the network that has a security certificate. </p> 

<p class="all_theme fp">5. Do not sign sign in except only on the official Lanterlite application which can be seen at <a class="all_theme fp" href="https://www.lanterlite.com/" target=" _blank ">www.lanterlite.com</a>. </p> 

<p class="all_theme fp">Thank you for your attention. </p>
