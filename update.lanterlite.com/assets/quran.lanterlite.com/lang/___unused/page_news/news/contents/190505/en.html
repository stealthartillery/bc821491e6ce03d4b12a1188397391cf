<p>Today, Enlite already has 4 reference books on its search engine, including the Qur'an, Bulughul Maram, Saheeh Bukhari, and Saheeh Muslim. The number of content currently has reached more than 19,000 content consisting of theorem of the Qur'an and the hadith and their narrators and some have had an explanation related to the degree of the hadith according to some scholars. Hopefully this can facilitate the community to continue to enrich themselves with a very broad Islamic sciences along with clear reference propositions.</p>
