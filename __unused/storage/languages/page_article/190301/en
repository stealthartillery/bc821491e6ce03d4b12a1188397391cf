Therefore, several methods of memorizing the Qur'an try to be done, such as memorizing methods using colors, memorizing by optimizing the senses of sight, hearing, movement, and so on."},

		{"span": "This method uses the concept of a library consisting of a number of bookshelves arranged in a row. In this method, space (space for storing books) from the shelf is arranged into 10 rows and 5 columns (10x5)."},

		{"elm" : "<br>"},

		{"span": "One of the benefits that I can get by this way is that I can slowly see patterns from a number of verses in one surah, as well as patterns from a number of surahs. One of the patterns I meant is the pattern of the relationship between the verse number (or surah) and the meaning of the verse. For example, surah Ar-Rahman (no. 55) and Al-Waqi'ah (no. 56) together discuss the people of hell starting with verse 41, where the previous verses on each surah discuss heaven or about the greatness of God. Masyaa Allah. So that we can deepen our knowledge regarding the miracle of the arrangement of surahs and verses in the Quran."},
